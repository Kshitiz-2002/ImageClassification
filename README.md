# Image Classification

## Overview

This project is focused on developing and evaluating a machine learning model using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier with stratified k-fold cross-validation. The goal is to classify instances into a binary class (e.g., detecting if an instance belongs to class 5 or not) using the MNIST dataset.

## Setup

1. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

2. **Dataset**: Download the MNIST dataset from [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or use a library like scikit-learn to load the dataset.

3. **Code**: Clone or download the project code from the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-project.git
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and prepare the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.

2. **Training**: Run the training script to train the SGD classifier with cross-validation:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This script performs stratified k-fold cross-validation using the SGDClassifier and StratifiedKFold from scikit-learn.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work

Neural Networks: Explore the use of neural network models, such as deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or fully connected networks (FCNs), to improve the classification performance further. Experiment with different network architectures, activation functions, optimizers, and hyperparameters to find the most effective model for the task.
